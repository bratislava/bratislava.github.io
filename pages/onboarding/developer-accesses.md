# Developer Accesses

Main team-wide accesses are listed in common onboarding - currently in Miro, and they usually come along with your @bratislava.sk account.

This page lists all the additional services that are needed for specific roles or projects.

We list them here so that you know about all the potential developer accesses you might need, but they are usually not needed during onboarding.
