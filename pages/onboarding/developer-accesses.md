# Developer Accesses

Main team-wide accesses are listed in common onboarding - currently in Miro, and they usually come along with your @bratislava.sk account.

This page lists all the additional services that are needed for specific roles or projects.

We list them here so that you know about all the potential developer accesses you might need, but they are usually not needed during onboarding.

## SSO accesses

If you are internal developer, and it's needed for your role (ask your buddy or project lead), you will be added into `OIADS_EMPLOYEES` group in Azure AD, which gives you access to:

- Harbor - [harbor.bratislava.sk](https://harbor.bratislava.sk/)
- Grafana - [grafana.bratislava.sk](https://grafana.bratislava.sk/)
- Minio - [cdn.bratislava.sk](https://cdn.bratislava.sk/) a [s3.bratislava.sk](https://console.s3.bratislava.sk/)

Guests / external developers can be arranged either via different group or assigned to the apps directly.
