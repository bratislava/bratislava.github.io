# Strapi best practices

## Creating content types - naming

<Steps>
### Create content type

Strapi does some magic with the name, so it's best to start with a clean name.

- ✅ Use singular, camelCase, small first letter
- ❌ Do not use underscores, dashes, spaces or special characters.

### Change display name

After the content type is created, change the display name to something readable also for the clients.

- ✅ Use plural where suitable, start with big letter, use spaces, use diacritics in slovak language.

</Steps>

This way, we can be sure that the content type has a well formatted name in code and also in admin UI.

## Content type fields

#### Required fields, title and slug

- ✅ Make all fields you rely on required.
- ✅ Always try to make at least one field required (usually `title` field) so in frontend, we have at least something to display, and we don't end up with empty entities.
- 💡 It is always recommended to have `title` field as required field of type `Short string`. It is used also for displaying the entity in admin UI (Strapi cannot display long string as main fields, or it is not able to search in them)
- 💡 If you need the title accepting new lines, create an optional field of type `Long text` and use it in frontend along with `title`. Use correct css class, usually `whitespace-pre-wrap`:

```tsx copy
<h2 className="whitespace-pre-wrap">{titleToDisplay ?? title}</h2>
```

- ✅ Setup `slug` as UID field connected to `title` - this way it will be autogenerated from title, and it will check uniqueness.
- ✅ We recommend to always setup `slug` as required field.
- 💡 Slugs should be set up for those content types that are meant to be accessed directly via URL. For example, `Article` content type should have slug. It is also recommended to have slug for content type that can be used in filters (e.g. `Category` - when we want to filter articles by category). We may want to use category slug in URL query parameter as well:

```
www.our-website.com/articles?category={category-slug}
```

#### Field naming

- ✅ Write field names in English.
- ✅ Use **camelCase** with small starting letter.
- ✅ Respect singular/plural in names (e.g. plural for repeatable components).
- ✅ When naming boolean fields, use `is` or other verb prefix (e.g. `isActive`, `hasBorder`, `inheritColor`).
- ❌ Do not use underscores, dashes, spaces or special characters.

#### Field options

- 💡 Identify which fields should be **required** and which not.
- 💡 Identify which fields should **NOT** be **localized**, so admins do not have to fill them twice for both locals (e.g. cover image, date of event, etc.)
- 💡 For enums, it is usually good idea to choose default value and to make the field required.
- 💡 For repeatable components, you can set up min and max number of items, so we don't end up with empty components, or we can rely on max columns in grid etc.

#### Common problems

- **Very long names:** Sometimes, creating a new field may lead to an `error: create index ... already exists`. This happens mostly for relational fields and it is probably caused by a limitation of Postgres. The solution is to shorten the name of the field, component or component group, because all these names are joined to create the database index.
