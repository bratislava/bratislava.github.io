# Introduction

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

This is the central repository for technical documentation of projects developed and maintained by [Department of Innovation and Technology of the City of Bratislava](https://inovacie.bratislava.sk). if you'd like to contribute, get in touch via [email](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk) or [github](https://github.com/bratislava/bratislava.github.io)

> If you are an individual or a company whoâ€™d like to take part in these efforts, collaborate closely on development or report an issue, weâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸ™Œ Contact us using this repository or at [innovationteam@bratislava.sk](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

Our goal is to be transparent about services weâ€™re developing and providing, as well as to invite other cities and municipalities to build on top of the same or similar open-source technologies weâ€™ve already tested and used - to foster [an ecosystem of collaboration](https://publiccode.eu) between teams facing similar challenges. Weâ€™ll be happy to [get in touch.](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

## Getting started

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ If you're a new contributor, member of the Innovations team or an external contractor, we recommend starting with [Editor setup](onboarding/editor-setup), then following other setups that are relevant for your role.

When you are done, it's useful to check out [how we handle environment variables](./deployment-and-infrastructure/env-vars-and-secrets) .

This documentation is a living document, and we encourage you to contribute to it. If you see something that's missing or incorrect, please [open an issue or create a PR](https://github.com/bratislava/bratislava.github.io).

<Callout>
  For internal developers:\
  There is also the main onboarding process common for the whole Innovations team (currently in Miro). If you haven't seen it, please approach you buddy or the team lead.

- **Frontend / Web development** - All the docs about common techniques, best practices, libraries and tools we use in frontend development, as well as about our CMS (Strapi) and fulltext-search tool (Meilisearch), which are also usually developed and maintained by the frontend team.
- **Backend development** - Libraries and services used by backend, common across multiple projects.
- **Deployment, infrastructure, monitoring** - Kubernetes, cloud services, Grafana.
- **Project specific documentation** - Contains documentation relevant only for the specific projects.
