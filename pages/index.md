# Introduction

This is the central repository for technical documentation of projects developed and maintained by [Department of Innovation and Technology of the City of Bratislava](https://inovacie.bratislava.sk). if you'd like to contribute, get in touch via [email](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk) or [github](https://github.com/bratislava/bratislava.github.io)

> If you are an individual or a company whoâ€™d like to take part in these efforts, collaborate closely on development or report an issue, weâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸ™Œ Contact us using this repository or at [innovationteam@bratislava.sk](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

Our goal is to be transparent about services weâ€™re developing and providing, as well as to invite other cities and municipalities to build on top of the same or similar open-source technologies weâ€™ve already tested and used - to foster [an ecosystem of collaboration](https://publiccode.eu) between teams facing similar challenges. Weâ€™ll be happy to [get in touch.](mailto:innovationteam@bratislava.sk)

## Getting started

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ If you're a new contributor, member of the Innovations team or an external contractor, these are the pages we recommend starting with:

### General

- [Editor setup](./recipes/editor-setup)
- [Git workflow](./recipes/git-workflow)
- [Docker setup](./recipes/docker-setup)
- [Postgres setup](./recipes/postgres-setup)

### Frontend

If you're not familiar with any of these technologies:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Strapi CMS](https://strapi.io/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), which we use for connecting Next to Strapi
- [GraphQL Codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/), which we use to generate typesafe SDK from our GraphQL queries
- [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/), often connected to Strapi via [meilisearch-strapi plugin](https://github.com/meilisearch/strapi-plugin-meilisearch)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)

Afterwards:

- [our GraphQL Codegen setup](./graphql)
- [how we handle environment variables](./recipes/env-vars-and-secrets)

### Backend

- [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)

Afterwards, you can check out the NextJS section of documentation for more details on how we use these technologies.

## Structure

### Recipes

This section serves as a "cookbook" for jobs and setups we need to do repeatedly. If you encounter (and struggle through) a task, steps of which were not trivial, and with which you can help with your newly gained knowledge, please write anything relevant into this section of the documentation.

### Deployment and infrastructure

Contains the documentation & information for tasks concerning deployment and maintenance of our apps on our Kubernetes clusters (or elsewhere). If you are an open-source contributor or an external contractor, you likely won't need to work with this part of the setup.

### _Technology-name_ pages

Contain information about our use of the technology or library common across all of our projects.

### _Project-name_ pages

Contain information specific to the project.

### Other

Organizational, onboarding, not related to development itself, other ðŸ™‚
