# Regular meetings, sync & rituals

These are for developers across all projects in the Inovations team. Each project may have it's own planning/standup/retrospective meets & calls, we're not covering those here.

## Regular meetings / calls

On **Monday at 9:00** there is a department-wide weekly standup, where we all (including the non-devs) share our agenda for the upcoming week.

**Every weekday at 9:00** (except for Monday) there is a short developer-only standup. This is mainly for sharing any potential blockers and getting in touch with people on the team you may need for the day.

> If you can't attend the morning standup please use #stand-up slack channel for a written version instead. The non-dev part of the team uses this each day, except for Monday.

**Every Friday at 11:00** we have a department wide retrospective session. This works mainly to keep in touch across all the different projects we work on, to celebrate goals we've reached and share any learnings with the rest of the team.

## Vacations / sick-days / home-office

Communicate all of these through slack with relevant people as well as through [vema](http://vema.bratislava.sk/).
