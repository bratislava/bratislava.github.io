It's important to keep your component controlled by value and onChange event.\nAdd your new component to styleguide, to show how it works. You should create component ShowCase in /components/styleguide/showcases/ where you will show all possible versions of the component wrapped in Wrapper and Stack. Then you will use ShowCase in /pages/styleguide.\nTo use correctly your component in RJSF, I would encourage you to create a widget wrapper (where you will use component) in /components/forms/widget-wrappers/ for multiple reasons.\nFirst reason to use a widget wrapper is the usage of custom props in your component. All RJSF widgets have these props available to use. But we may want to use some more custom props. They can be passed in options object in prop. You should read all custom props from options in the widget wrapper and pass them to the original component.\nSecond reason to use a widget wrapper is handling of onChange and value types. Some components like DatePicker, Select, or Upload may have not primitive types like string, number or array, etc., which are needed in RJSF. It's necessary to handle value and onChange types, to be compatible with the original component.\nMap your widget component into schema. In /components/forms/ThemedForm.tsx add it in object theme inside widgets property. You can also choose a special name for the component in RJSF.\nNow we can use components in any RJSF form. For testing purposes, we can use it in /backend/forms/test. We can reach this form in a browser at URL /forms/test.\nAdd a new form widget in schema.json. There is a list of all form steps. It's better to create a new step where you can create multiple form widgets which will use your custom component. You can read how to add the custom component in schema.json at RJSF docs. You need to choose value type and optionally also the title and which form widgets will be required.\nDefine which custom component will be used in uiSchema.json. Do not forget, you must define form widgets exactly like they are nested in schema.json. It's possible to choose which custom component will be used in the form for chosen widget through \"ui:widget\" with a name you choose when you mapped your component in ThemedForm. If you want to forbid the default label, you can set \"ui:label\" to false. It's possible to set here multiple component props. All custom props, which are not defined by RJSF, is possible to set through \"ui:options\".

The query language can do a lot of things, but for monitoring on simple phrases we just need a simple expression that selects our application within {}, wrapped in count_over_time function.\ncount_over_time({cluster=\"tkg-innov-prod\", namespace=\"standalone\", app=\"example-app\"} |= \"ERROR\" [10m])\nAfter {} selection, we have |= operator, which matches exactly the expression \"ERROR\".

We need to create two more expressions, one with Operation \"Reduce\" and the next with Operation \"Math\".\nFor \"Reduce\", we want to select \"Last\" function, which reduces our query to last know value\nFor \"Math\", we want to put our math expression, in our case,\nwe want to alert on any one occurrence of \"ERROR\".

Once the reviewer is satisfied, they'll assign a fix & ship label, leaving it up to the author to merge at his or hers convenience, optionally fixing some minor issues before doing so (without the need for a further review).Some projects have already set up automatic labeling depending on PR state (PR Labeler workflow).","resolving-conversations#Resolving conversations":"It is helpful to resolve (github) conversations you have started if you feel the topic has been answered.

It is used also for displaying the entity in admin UI (Strapi cannot display long string as main fields, or it is not able to search in them)\n💡 If you need the title accepting new lines, create an optional field of type Long text and use it in frontend along with title. Use correct css class, usually whitespace-pre-wrap:\n\n\n<h2 className=\"whitespace-pre-wrap\">{titleToDisplay ?? title}</h2>\n\n✅ Setup slug as UID field connected to title - this way it will be autogenerated from title, and it will check uniqueness.\n✅ We recommend to always setup slug as required field.\n💡 Slugs should be set up for those content types that are meant to be accessed directly via URL. For example, Article content type should have slug. It is also recommended to have slug for content type that can be used in filters (e.g. Category - when we want to filter articles by category). We may want to use category slug in URL query parameter as well:\n\n\nwww.our-website.com/articles?category={category-slug}","field-naming#Field naming":"✅ Write field names in English.\n✅ Use camelCase with small starting letter.\n✅ Respect singular/plural in names (e.g. plural for repeatable components).\n✅ When naming boolean fields, use is or other verb prefix (e.g. isActive, hasBorder, inheritColor).\n❌ Do not use underscores, dashes, spaces or special characters.","field-options#Field options":"💡 Identify which fields should be required and which not.\n💡 Identify which fields should NOT be localized, so admins do not have to fill them twice for both locals (e.g. cover image, date of event, etc.)\n💡 For enums, it is usually good idea to choose default value and to make the field required.\n💡 For repeatable components, you can set up min and max number of items, so we don't end up with empty components, or we can rely on max columns in grid etc.","common-problems#Common problems":"Very long names: Sometimes, creating a new field may lead to an error: create index ... already exists. This happens mostly for relational fields and it is probably caused by a limitation of Postgres.

An example of this are \"Events\" from city-library.Each of the Event pages contains a cover image, date, title, a rich-text field for text detail, and a few other fields. To implement this, Event is first created as a content-type model within our Strapi server and populated with all the fields we may require (again, refer to Strapi docs). Instances of the Event model are then pulled into our frontend app using GraphQL.For more info on GraphQL, getting the GraphQL data into React and browsing the gql queries see the appropriate section.In this use-case, data is always 'consumed' by the same React component(s).","dynamic-content-with-strapi-cms#Dynamic content with Strapi CMS":"Sometimes we want a more 'page-builder' like experience as a Strapi administrator - we may want to add various different React components (think rich-text, tables, galleries, accordions...) to the page or article we are writing, and have control over the order in which they appear. To do this, we are using Strapi components - not to be confused with React components, these are simply reusable data models or in other words combinations of several Strapi data fields - which we then place into Dynamic Zones within their parent content-type. You can see how Dynamic Zones are fetched with GraphQL here.On React's side, we then need to map each Strapi Component instance to an instance of a React component which can render it's data. There is usually a one-to-one mapping between the __typename field fetched via gql and a React component. A good example of this is the Sections.tsx file from bratislava.sk page:\nconst SectionContent = ({ section, locale }: { section: SectionsFragment; locale?: string }) => {\nconst { t } = useTranslation(\"common\")\nswitch (section.__typename) {\ncase \"ComponentSectionsNarrowText\":\nreturn (\n<NarrowText\nalign={section.align ?? undefined}\ncontent={section.content ?? undefined}\nwidth={section.width ?? undefined}\nhasBackground={section.hasBackground ?? false}\n/>\n)\n\ncase \"ComponentSectionsIconTitleDesc\":\nreturn (\n<RentBenefits\ntitle={section.title}\nlist={section.list}\nlinkLabel={t(\"readMore\")}\nhasBackground={section.hasBackground ?? false}\n/>\n)\n\ncase \"ComponentSectionsDocumentList\":\nreturn <DocumentList />\n\ncase \"ComponentSectionsColumnedText\":\nreturn (\n<ColumnedText\ncontent={section.content ?? \"\"}\nhasBackground={section.hasBackground ?? false}\n/>\n)\n// ... and many more sections cases\n}\n}\n\nconst Sections = ({\nsections,\nlocale,\n}: {\nsections: (SectionsFragment | null)[]\nlocale?: string\n}) => {\nreturn (\n<>\n{sections.map((section, index) => (\n// eslint-disable-next-line react/no-array-index-key\n<SectionContent key={index} section={section} locale={locale} />\n))}\n</>\n)\n}\n\nexport default Sections\nMapping the data this way, we'll get our page-builder experience - the CMS admins being able to add new dynamic React components (from a pre-defined set) to their articles by adding the matching Strapi component to lists of dynamic zones within Strapi.","multiple-dynamic-sections#Multiple dynamic sections":"You may require multiple 'dynamic' sections within your content-types.

You can use an online base64 converter like https://www.base64encode.org and encode banana to YmFuYW5h. This has to happen even if the value you want to provide is base64 encoded! In such case you'll take your base64 encoded value and encode it again.The last thing is encrypting our secrets by kubeseal to be used on Kubernetes. You need to run this command that creates the file database.secret.yml where all our values are encrypted and safe to add to the repository.Before running this command be sure you are logged in right cluster kubectl config use-context tkg-innov-<env> (replace <env> with one of dev, staging or prod. Cluster you are logged in is used when generating secret.

Usually, we replace it with <replace-with-base64-password>.
