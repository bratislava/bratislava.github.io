# Docker setup

If you are on Linux or macOS, we recommend installing [Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

If you are running from Windows WSL ([setup here](./wsl.md)), you might be better off using [podman](https://podman.io/) instead. In this case, you'll also need to install & setup [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose). Use `podman` and `podman-compose` as substitute everytime you see `docker` or `docker compose`.
